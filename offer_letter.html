            Employee will take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized persons or entities from obtaining, receiving, or gaining access to any Confidential Information in Employee's possession or control. Nothing prohibits Employee from reporting an event that he or she reasonably believes is a legal violation to a law-enforcement agency (such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST), the Ministry of Labour and Employment), or from cooperating in an agency investigation. Employee acknowledges that he or she is bound by confidentiality obligations under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and other applicable legal principles. The employee will not be held criminally or civilly liable under Indian trade secret law for disclosing a trade secret in confidence to a government official, attorney, or relevant authority for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected legal violation, provided such disclosure is made in good faith. Additionally, an individual who initiates a lawsuit for unlawful retaliation against his or her employer for reporting a suspected legal violation may disclose the trade secret to his or her attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, provided any document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and is not disclosed unless permitted by court order.

In order for MyAccess to protect its Confidential Information and assess any potential conflict of interest, prior to accepting any employment or consulting relationship with any third party for work during Employee's employment with Employer, Employee will provide prior written notice to Employee's manager and discuss with such manager any potential conflict of interest in performing such outside work. In addition, unless Employee receives prior written consent from a Vice President of Employer, during the period of Employee's employment with Employer, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, and whether or not for compensation, either on Employee's own behalf or as an employee, officer, agent, consultant, director, owner, partner, joint venturer, shareholder, investor, or in any other capacity (except in the capacity of an employee of Employer acting for the benefit of Employer), knowingly engage in any activity or business which is of the same nature as, or competitive with, the business of Employer.

Employee further acknowledges that, in the context of threatened or actual unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, the following actions will create a reasonable inference that Employee will not or cannot comply with the continuing obligations in this Agreement regarding confidentiality, on which such inference a request for injunctive or equitable relief by MyAccess may be based:

            <span class="subsection-number">4.4 Non-Interference.</span>
            During employment and for 12 months after the Separation Date, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, whether on Employee's own behalf or on behalf of any other entity (for example, as an employee, agent, partner, or consultant):
            (a) solicit or otherwise encourage any employee, contractor, or consultant of MyAccess ("MyAccess Personnel") to terminate any employment or contractual relationship with MyAccess;(b) disclose information to any other individual or entity about MyAccess Personnel that could be used to solicit or otherwise encourage MyAccess Personnel to form new business relationships with that or another individual or entity; or(c) otherwise interfere with the performance by current or former MyAccess Personnel of their obligations or responsibilities to MyAccess. Nothing in this Section 4.4 restricts Employee from exercising rights protected under the National Labor Relations Act.

            <span class="subsection-number">4.5 Reasonableness of Restrictions.</span>
            Employee recognizes that the restrictions in this Section 4 may significantly limit Employee's future flexibility in many ways. For example, the restriction in Section 4.1 will bar Employee from working for certain competitive opportunities while employed by Employer. Employee further recognizes that the geographic areas for many of MyAccess's products and services - and, by extension, the geographic areas applicable to certain restrictions in this Section 4 are extremely broad and in many cases worldwide. Employee agrees and acknowledges that the restrictions in this Section 4 are reasonable in scope, area, and duration, and will not result in any undue hardship for Employee.
